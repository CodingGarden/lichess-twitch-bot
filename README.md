# Lichess Twitch Bot

A quick and dirty twitch bot that allows twitch chat to play chess against a stream on lichess.

```sh
npm install
cp .env.sample .env # update .env with your values
node src/index.js # invite the bot to a game
```

# TODO

* And, how to offer draws, resign
* On next time: Validate moves before factoring votes, Show Check, handle castling, arrows instead of cell colors, change cell colors previous move only, promoting pieces, SFX perhaps, show vote "leaderboard" next to/outside board perhaps? Show CJ vs Chat's turn above/below board.
